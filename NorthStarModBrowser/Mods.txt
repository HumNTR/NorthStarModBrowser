*The.Pilot;Bolexle;https://github.com/Bolexle/The.Pilot;446763132;0;The Pilot
New Gamemode, heavily borrowed from the Hidden code and @H0L0's Grunt mode.
1 player chosen as pilot
    They are invisible except for high speed movement and melee.
    They only have melee to kill with
    They gain bonus health, that only regens up to a certain low value (same as normal pilot)
    They have sonar and grapple
The rest of the players become grunts
    They cannot double jump or wallrun
    They have an r201 and arc grenades
    They can only find the Pilot when he briefly appears or by finding his hovered name plate
The Pilot wins by killing all the grunts. The grunts win by surviving till the timeout or by killing the Pilot.

*Spoons.Bubbles;ASpoonPlaysGames;https://github.com/ASpoonPlaysGames/Spoons.Bubbles;450326954;0;Allows users to have customisable dome shield colours!

Server-side or Client-side?
Spoons.Bubbles is a client-optional, server-sided mod.
 Players who do not have the mod will see the custom colours,
 but will not be able to set their own automatically, they would have to use AddCustomBubble (see below) to set their own colour

Setting a colour
There are 3 main ways of setting your custom dome shield colour, each with varying levels of permanence.

Note: your custom colour will not work if the server does not have Spoons.Bubbles. (so pester them to add it >:) )

Using autoexec_spoons_bubbles.cfg (recommended)
You can use the .cfg file found at .../R2Northstar/mods/Spoons.Bubbles/mod/cfg/autoexec_spoons_bubbles.cfg
 to set your dome shield colour on a permanent basis.

Usage:
Navigate to .../R2Northstar/mods/Spoons.Bubbles/mod/cfg and open the file autoexec_spoons_bubbles.cfg with a text editor (notepad, vscode, etc.)
Make note of the commented text in the file

Using SetCustomBubble
Using SetCustomBubble is a quick and easy way to change your dome shield colour mid-match,
however it will be reset when the match ends, or you leave the server.
Basically any time that you see a loading screen, AddCustomBubble will have been reset

Usage:
SetCustomBubble <r> <g> <b>

Example:
"SetCustomBubble 255 0 255" will make a pink dome shield

image

Using SetCustomAnimBubble
Using SetCustomAnimBubble does the same job as SetCustomBubble, but it supports animations

Usage:
SetCustomAnimBubble <r> <g> <b> <t>|<r> <g> <b> <t>|<r> <g> <b> <t> etc.
